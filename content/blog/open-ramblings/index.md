A little over a year ago now algebraic effects had made waves on some dev blogs in the circles I keep my eyes on. 
It was perhaps Dan Abramov's article[^1] that first caught my attention, followed shortly thereafter by Sam Galton's article [^2].
There were a few more a long the way [^3][^4].

Algebraic Effects had also been growing quite popular on the `r/ProgrammingLanguages` subreddit, which is where I was introduced to [eff-lang](https://www.eff-lang.org/). 
The people over there are a wonderful resource, I ended up getting a few white papers where I tried to penetrate some of the theory behind what effects were.
